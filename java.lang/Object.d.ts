             * - It is *consistent*: for any non-null reference values `x` and `y`, multiple invocations of `x.equals(y)` consistently return `true` or consistently return `false`, provided no information used in `equals` comparisons on the objects is modified.

             * ```

             *
             * By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent of this object (which is being cloned). To achieve this independence, it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned by `super.clone` before returning it. Typically, this means copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure" of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these objects with references to the copies. If a class contains only primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually the case that no fields in the object returned by `super.clone` need to be modified.
             *
             * The method `clone` for class `Object` performs a specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does not implement the interface `Cloneable`, then a `CloneNotSupportedException` is thrown. Note that all arrays are considered to implement the interface `Cloneable` and that the return type of the `clone` method of an array type `T[]` is `T[]` where T is any reference or primitive type. Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
             *
             * The class `Object` does not itself implement the interface `Cloneable`, so calling the `clone` method on an object whose class is `Object` will result in throwing an exception at run time.

             *
             * This method causes the current thread (referred to here a *T*) to place itself in the wait set for this object and then to relinquish any and all synchronization claims on this object. Note that on the locks on this object are relinquished; any other objects on which the current thread may be synchronized remain locked while the thread waits.
             *
             * Thread *T* then becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of four things happens:
             * - Some other thread invokes the `notify` method for this object and thread *T* happens to be arbitrarily chosen as the thread to be awakened.
             * - Some other thread invokes the `notifyAll` method for this object.
             * - Some other thread interrupts thread *T*.
             * - The specified amount of real time has elapsed, more or less. The amount of real time, measured in nanoseconds, is given by the expression `1000000 * timeoutMillis + nanos`. If `timeoutMillis` and `nanos` are both zero, then real time is not taken into consideration and the thread waits until awakened by one of the other causes.
             *
             * The thread *T* is then removed from the wait set for this object and re-enabled for thread scheduling. It then competes in the usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the object; once it has gained control of the object, all its synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the `wait` method was invoked. Thread *T* then returns from the invocation of the `wait` method. Thus, on return from the `wait` method, the synchronization state of the object and of thread *T* is exactly as it was when the `wait` method was invoked.
             *
             * A thread can wake up without being notified, interrupted, or timing out, a so-called *spurious wakeup*. While this will rarely occur in practice, applications must guard against it by testing for the condition that should have caused the thread to be awakened, and continuing to wait if the condition is not satisfied. See the example below.
             *
             * For more information on this topic, see section 14.2, "Conditional Queues", in Brian Goetz and others' *Java Concurrency in Practice* (Addison-Wesley, 2006) or Item 69 in Joshua Bloch's *Effective Java*, Second Edition (Addison-Wesley, 2008).
             *
             * If the current thread is interrupted by any thread before or while it is waiting, then an `InterruptedException` is thrown. The *interrupted status* of the current thread is cleared when this exception is thrown. This exception is not thrown until the lock status of this object has been restored as described above.

             * **API Note:**
             *

             *
             * @since 9.0
             * @deprecated *The finalization mechanism is inherently problematic. Finalization can lead to performance issues, deadlocks, and hangs. Errors in finalizers can lead to resource leaks; there is no way to cancel finalization if it is no longer necessary; and no ordering is specified among calls to finalize methods of different objects. Furthermore, there are no guarantees regarding the timing of finalization. The `finalize` method might be called on a finalizable object only after an indefinite delay, if at all. Classes whose instances hold no-heap resources should provide a method to enable explicit release of those resources, and they should also implement {@link AutoCloseable} if appropriate. The {@link java.lang.ref.Cleaner Cleaner} and {@link java.lang.ref.PhantomReference PhantomReference} provide more flexible and efficient way to release resources when an object becomes unreachable.*
             *
             * Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object. A subclass overrides the `finalize` method to dispose of system resources or to perform other cleanup.
             *
             * The general contract of `finalize` is that it is invoked if and when the Javaâ„¢ virtual machine has determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be finalized. The `finalize` method may take any action, including making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose of `finalize`, however, is to perform cleanup actions before the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is permanently discarded.
             *
             * The `finalize` method of class `Object` performs no special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of `Object` may override this definition.
             *
             * The Javaâ„¢ programming language does not guarantee which thread will invoke the `finalize` method for any given object. It is guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes `finalize` will not be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when `finalize` is invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the `finalize` method, the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.
             *
             * After the `finalize` method has been invoked for an object, no further action is taken until the Javaâ„¢ virtual machine has again determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized, at which point the object may be discarded.
             *
             * The `finalize` method is never invoked more than once by a Javaâ„¢ virtual machine for any given object.
             *
             * Any exception thrown by the `finalize` method causes the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise ignored.
             *
             * **API Note:**
             *
             * Classes that embed non-heap resources have many options for cleanup of those resources. The class must ensure that the lifetime of each instance is longer than that of any resource it embeds. {@link java.lang.ref.Reference.reachabilityFence Reference.reachabilityFence(java.lang.Object)} can be used to ensure that objects remain reachable while resources embedded in the object are in use.
             *
             * A subclass should avoid overriding the `finalize` method unless the subclass embeds non-heap resources that must be cleaned up before the instance is collected. Finalizer invocations are not automatically chained, unlike constructors. If a subclass overrides `finalize` it must invoke the superclass finalizer explicitly. To guard against exceptions prematurely terminating the finalize chain, the subclass should use a `try-finally` block to ensure `super.finalize()` is always invoked. For example,
             * ```java
             *      @Override
             *      protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
             *          try {
             *              ... // cleanup subclass state
             *          } finally {
